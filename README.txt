Project Overview
This project implements a basic ANN model to predict target variables based on the provided features. The model is built with the following key components:

Data Preprocessing: Importing and preparing the dataset.
Model Architecture: Designing an ANN with two hidden layers.
Model Training: Training the model using the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss.
Prediction: Evaluating the model's performance on the test set.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is Folds5x2_pp.xlsx, which includes various features relevant to the prediction task. The dataset is split into training and test sets for model training and evaluation.
